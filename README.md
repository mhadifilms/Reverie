## Implementation Notes

### Spotify Parsing

Uses **pure Swift HTML parsing** to extract Spotify's embedded `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON blob from playlist pages. No API key required, works with any public playlist.

**Potential issues:** Spotify may change their HTML structure over time.  
**Fallback:** Spotify Web API with Client Credentials flow (requires free developer app).

### YouTube Resolution

Uses **YouTubeKit** to handle YouTube's signature cipher and n-parameter throttling. This is critical because:
- YouTube scrambles stream URLs with JavaScript-based ciphers
- These ciphers change regularly (sometimes weekly)
- Without proper descrambling, most videos won't work
- Downloads are throttled to ~50KB/s without n-parameter fix

YouTubeKit handles all this automatically with local extraction + remote fallback.

### Audio Format

Downloads **m4a (AAC)** at 128-256kbps from YouTube. This is:
- YouTube's native audio format (no transcoding needed)
- Apple's preferred format (plays natively on iOS/macOS)
- Small file size (~3-5MB per song)
- Excellent quality for streaming audio

No need for FLAC - you can't add fidelity that isn't in the source.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] **Now Playing UI** - Full-screen view with waveform visualizer
- [ ] **MusicBrainz Search** - Search for songs without Spotify
- [ ] **Mini Player** - Persistent playback bar
- [ ] **Lyrics** - Synced lyrics display (via LRCLIB)
- [ ] **Apple Music Import** - Support Apple Music playlists

## Known Issues

1. **Spotify HTML Changes** - If Spotify updates their page structure, parsing may break
   - *Mitigation:* Implement Spotify Web API fallback
   
2. **YouTube Cipher Updates** - YouTubeKit handles this automatically
   - *Mitigation:* Keep YouTubeKit updated

3. **Large Playlists** - Playlists with 500+ songs may take time to download
   - *Current:* Progress tracking shows estimated time
